    island perimeter solution

    Reasoning: find the perimeter of all island squares, then
    subtract the sides that touch each other from the total perimeter

    If a side is shared between two squares, then we'll need to
    subtract 2 * side since each one of the two squares has that side
    bordering the neighbouring square
